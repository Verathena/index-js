• Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category
Statically typed is a programming language characteristic in which variable types are explicitly declared and thus are determined at compile time. This lets the compiler decide whether a given variable can perform the actions requested from it or not. Static typing associates types with variables, not with values. Some examples of statically typed programming languages include: Haskell, FORTRAN, Java, C, C#, C++, Ada, Jade, Pascal, ML, Perl, Scala
Dynamically-typed languages are those where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time. Some examples of programming languages that belong to this category are Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua, and Tcl.

• Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined;
The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value. The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference.
